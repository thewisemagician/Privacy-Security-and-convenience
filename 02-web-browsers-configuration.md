# Which Web Browser to use:

## TLDR basic:

Stop using chrome, Install Firefox

## Convenience:

Not much gain right now but, we will install a few addons which will help in the next chapter.


## Why is it important:

While Google chrome is an amazing browser it is full of trackers and helps Google tracking your activity across the web. Firefox is an opensource web browser made by the Mozilla foundation which value your privacy and security more than Google.

# Firefox configuration

## TLDR basic:

Install the following addons

* Ublock origin (stop adverting from tracking you)
* HTTPS everywhere (force secure communication when available)
* Decentraleyes (avoid tracking from cloud companies and improve performances if you have a slow connection)
* Facebook container (isolate facebook in a sandbox so it can't track your activity)
* Google container (same as facebook container)
* Twitter container (same)
* Reddit container (same)

Create a firefox account so those settings are synchronized in all your browser (and you don't have to install this every single time you setup a new firefox

## TLDR advanced:

Install all the basic addons and add the following one.

* Umatrix or noscript (will break some website)
* Cookie cleaner

## Convenience:

With this you are blocking 90% of the tracking and other distracting advertisement in your daily browsing activity. You should see a major improvement helping you focus on your work and what really matters.

You are also isolating social media website from your normal browsing without the need to use two different browser. All of this without any effort from you.


## Why is it important:

IMHO those addons are pure benefit since they protect you from the most commons tracking online and improve your productivity/focus.
