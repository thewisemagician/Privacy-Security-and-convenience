# Your personal device (laptop/tablet/phone etc).

## TLDR basic:

Enable full disk encryption on all your mobile devices.

* Iphones and Apple computers are by default encrypted
* Android is also by default but, if you have an old device go in settings -> memory -> enable encryption

## TLDR advanced:

Enable encryption on your computer too

* Windows 10: Install VeraCrypt
* MacOSX: They are by default encrypted. If you are using an old version, check Apple documentation how to enable it.
* Linux: Check for your distro documentation how to setup LUKS

## Convenience:

Once enable you don't have to worry about it anymore. The daily usage remain virtually unchanged. Be aware if you loose your password you won't be able to access your data. Store it in your password manager (check the next section for more information)


## Why is it important:

By default usually the memory of your device isn't encrypted and if you loose your device it's trivial to recover/steal the data inside. It's especially important when you travel with confidential documents.
