# Cloud storage

## TLDR basic

If you still want to use a popular cloud provider just encrypt everything before uploading/sync. You can use a software like [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/) to handle it for you.

A good advice is to keep a "public" folder unencrypted to easily share things with our friends. While it's possible to share encrypted files, it's easier to just have a separate folder.

## TLDR advanced:

Buy a NAS like [QNAP](https://www.qnap.com/en-us/) or [https://www.synology.com/en-global](Synology) and create your own cloud service. Not only it's extensible and a cheaper option in the long run but you have full control of your data. Be aware having your own server require some maintenance and don't forget to also enable full disk encryption.

## Convenience:

If you setup the first advice (keep your current cloud provider) and encrypt everything once you install Cryptomator you have pretty much no difference in the daily usage.

If you go with the route of your own server at home, it's also cheaper to add storage. At work we have a 160 TB backup system for a fraction of what it would cost us in a cloud service.

## Why is it important:

Making sure your documents are protected is important and you should be the only one who decide who can read them. If you choose the path of your own server you have the added benefit to retain full control (and potentially higher performance since everything is local). Even if you are banned from your cloud provider, you will not loose access to your data.
