# Operating system

## TLDR basic:

This section depend vastly on which operating system you are using.

### Windows

* While you can stay on Windows be aware it is a privacy nightmare and collect a lot of data in the background. It's recommended in the long run to switch to Linux.
* if you are using windows 10, use an open source tool like DisableWinTracking to reduce the tracking.
* Avoid using Microsoft edge (see the browser section to check how to configure firefox)
* Remove bloatware (useless crap software that come preinstalled). They slow down your computer and take away precious resources.

### Mac OSX

* If you are using Mac OSX, I lack experience but I don't think it tracks you as much as Windows 10. However I would also consider moving to Linux in the long run if you want to add another lever of protection.

### Linux
* If you are using Linux you are fine :). Nothing to change here!

## TLDR advanced:

Try to switch to Linux (Depending on your computer usage it might be easier than you might imagine. However I actually think it might be a bit overkill for this guide, but if you look to easily improve your security and privacy, you should do it.
* Try Linux on a virtual machine to get familiar with the system, before installing it on your computer.
* You can also use it on an old machine since it requires less ressources to run.


## Important:

Regardless of the operating system you are using, make sure you keep it up to date. There have been countless case of exploits being fixed but still infecting older versions.


## Convenience:

Removing crappy software makes your computer runs faster because it doesn't have to spend resource on those bloatware.
