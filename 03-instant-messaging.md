# Instant Messaging

Be aware many instant messaging apps aren't end to end encrypted.

## TLDR basic:
* If you are already using Whatsapp, be aware that only your messages are encrypted E2E it's owned by Facebook and they collect metadata. Consider moving in the long run to more secure and private solutions like Telegram or even better Signal.
  * Disable cloud backup sync, since it would upload your messages encrypted to a cloud service.
* Telegram is also okay but remember to always enable encryption (by starting a secret conversation you enable E2E encryption).
* The best option would be to switch to Signal, however convincing your friends to switch might be difficult.
* Avoid to use Facebook Messenger, Wechat, Twitter, Slack, MS Teams, etc **especially for confidential information.**

## Convenience:
Not much gain but by moving to a more private solution like Signal or Telegram you are reducing your exposure to major tracking companies like Facebook. Virtually all those IM apps have more or less the same features. The most difficult part will be to convince your friends to switch.
