# Instant Messaging

Be aware many instant messaging apps aren't end to end encrypted.

## TLDR basic:
* If you have nothing, Whatsapp isn't so bad while it's owned by Facebook the messages are E2E
* Disable cloud backup sync, since it would upload your messages to a cloud service.
* Telegram is also okay but remember to always enable encryption (since it's not by default, you have to start a secret conversation)
* It's better to use something like signal (however you have to convince your friends and family to switch
* Avoid to use Facebook Messenger, Wechat, Twitter, Slack, MS Teams, etc **especially for confidential information.**

## Convenience:

Not much gain but you are reducing your exposure to tracking. You also need to be aware for the advanced advice It's difficult to make other people switch to fully encrypted service.
