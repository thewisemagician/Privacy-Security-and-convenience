# Passwords and online accounts:

## TLDR basic:

Use a cloud password manager and stop caring about remembering all those password. I recommend Bitwarden if you aren't already using one.

## TLDR advanced:

Use an offline password manager (with the database stored in an USB key). More secure but less convenient. I recommend Keepass if you want an offline password manager.

## Convenience:

You don't have do remember thousand of different passwords anymore and each account has a unique password.


## Why is it important:

Passwords are super annoying to create, remember and we all know how painful it is when we create an account.

An easy way to create password is to put 5 random words together in a string, which is easy to remember but hard to crack. I won't go in details about why this is a better solution than random characters.

However it's still annoying to have hundred of account/password to remember. In short you should just use a password manager which stores your passwords. You have only one password to remember.

By doing this you will significantly increase your productivity and convenience (not having to ever remember passwords.
