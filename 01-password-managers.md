# Passwords and online accounts:

## TLDR basic:

* Use a cloud password manager [1] and stop caring about remembering all those password. [I recommend Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) if you aren't already using one.
* To create a good password you can create a passphrase by chaining 5 random words [2]. [A very good explanation on how to do this and why it works is on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware)

## TLDR advanced:

* Use an offline password manager (with the database stored in an USB key). More secure but less convenient. [I recommend Keepass](https://keepass.info/index.html) if you want an offline password manager.

## Convenience:

You don't have do remember thousand of different passwords anymore and each account has a unique password.


## Why is it important:

We all know we should use unique and complicated passwords [3], but they are super annoying to create, remember and we all know how painful it is when we create an account.

An easy way to create password is to put 5 random words together in a string, which is easy to remember but hard to crack. I won't go in details about why this is a better solution than random characters (you can read the article on wikipedia if you want more information).

However it's still annoying to have hundred of account/password to remember. In short you should just use a password manager which stores your passwords. You have only one password to remember.

By doing this you will significantly increase your productivity and convenience (not having to ever remember passwords).
