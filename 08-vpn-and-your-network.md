## TLDR basic:

* Setup PI-Hole on your network (block tracking across your network and require almost no interaction from your part).
* If you really want, you could setup a VPN on your router so all your devices benefit from it, and you hide all your traffic from your ISP + avoid IP geolocation.
* If you are using an insecure WIFI in a public space you SHOULD USE a VPN.

## TLDR advanced:

* Rent a VPS and become your own VPN. This again allows to have an almost full control over the VPN. Avoid to rent a VPS in one of the popular cloud company, like Amazon.


## Convenience:
Setting up a VPN and a Pi-Hole is really easy and will virtually change nothing to your daily activities. However they will improve significantly your protection both privacy and security.

## Why is it important:

The most important thing you can do is install a PI-Hole on your network to protect all your device even things like Smart Tv which aren't easily modifiable. Once you have it running you have nothing specific to do, it just works on it's own.


VPN are controversial I also will avoid recommending a specific VPN. Avoid free VPN which are most of the time a hidden data collection operation. One of the main advantage of VPN is to avoid IP geolocation (which is almost impossible to get rid off).
