#### A word about me:

This guide is based on my experience as a security advisor in a small company. My goal is to make sure people follow our advice and don't get burned out by our security / privacy policy. We perfectly know us, human we don't like changes and we love convenience.

*IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: This guide isn't meant for people who are paranoid, and the advice given here will probably make a few privacy aficionados cry. The goal number one of this guide is to go after the hanging fruits.*

Each sections into two parts, the first one is the basic with almost no impact in your daily work flow the second is a bit more advanced and might require more changes. I also explain how the change will improve your convenience and what you will gain.
