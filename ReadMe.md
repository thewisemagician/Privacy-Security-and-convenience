We all know most popular cloud providers will try to gather as many data as possible about you, your friends and familly.

Let's pause a moment there: Imagine If a real person would do that, this behavior is called stalking, and not only it sounds weird but it's creepy as hell.

# You should not let yourself be subjected to criminal abuse

Many people believe it's not possible to combine convenience, privacy and security. Usually they don't want to be bothered with more things to think about. In this guide I'm going to explain how with minimal change you can make a big difference and protecting your data/online activities.

> I believe it's possible to actually combine both and in many case you will improve your digital life.

#### A word about me:

This guide is based on my experience as a security advisor in a small company. My goal is to make sure people follow our advice and don't get burned out by our security / privacy policy. We perfectly know us, human we don't like changes and we love convenience.

*IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: This guide isn't meant for people who are paranoid, and the advice given here will probably make a few privacy aficionados cry. The goal number one of this guide is to go after the hanging fruits.*

Each sections into two parts, the first one is the basic with almost no impact in your daily work flow the second is a bit more advanced and might require more changes. I also explain how the change will improve your convenience and what you will gain.

#### What will you gain from this guide?

Security and privacy can quickly burn even the most motivated expert. It's crucial to not burn yourself while going through this journey.

Here is a quick outline of what you will get by following this guide.
* All our digital devices are now encrypted. If they are stolen or lost it's almost impossible to recover the data
* We have strong and unique passwords for all the services and we only need to remember the master password of the password manager.
* We switched our browser to Firefox and lowered the amount of data collected by Google
* We installed a couple of addons to hide distracting advertisement and improve our productivity and force HTTPS whenever possible.
* We also separated our social media life with our main browsing in a container without having to use a second browser.
* We are now using E2E encrypted instant messages, and maybe you even convinced your friends to switch to signal.
* We encrypt our mails and we gained independence from mail hosting service by having our own domain. We have the freedom to move and change provider if needed.
* All data uploaded to cloud service is encrypted. If you are really into it you might even have setup your own cloud server (with a NAS like Synology)
* We disabled most of the tracking on Windows 10.
* We have a network wide tracking blocker to help secure device which aren't configurable. Maybe we even have a VPN to avoid IP geolocation and connect in unsecure Wifi access point.
